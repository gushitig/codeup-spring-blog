The main purpose of an Integration Test is to verify the interaction between the MVC units. That's why we will instruct JUnit to do some of the following:

Provide a full servlet engine behavior
Load the @Controllers
Load the @Services
Load the @Repositories


-do this in a test folder



JUnit requires you to specify at least three things:

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class): SpringRunner is an alias for the SpringJUnit4ClassRunner, which joins the JUnit testing library with the Spring TestContext Framework.
@SpringBootTest(classes = SpringblogApplication.class): This annotation tells the framework which Java Class with a main method starts the application. You can find this file under a path like this /src/main/java/com/codeup/springblog/SpringblogApplication.java. The name could be different from this example; it depends on your initial configuration and project purpose.
@AutoConfigureMockMvc: This is an annotation that can be applied to a test class to enable and configure auto-configuration of MockMvc.

Servlets were the backend part and the jsps were the front end part

in spring we're going to use something similar to jsps but a lot simper called views
    -we will be doing this using thymeleaf





    Other Tags
    each
    Very similar to the enhanced for-loop syntax in Java, this tag allows us to loop over a collection.


    <div th:each="item : ${shoppingCart}">
        <p th:text="${item.name}" />
    </div>
    Documentation

    if

    <div class="alert alert-danger" th:if="${page_has_error}">
        Something bad happened!
    </div>



    TEMPLATING
    all the partials can go into one html file
    thymeleaf calls them fragments


    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
    <head th:fragment="head">
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Home</title>
        <!-- include stylesheets, etc here -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <nav th:fragment="navbar">
            <!-- awesome navbar goes here -->
        </nav>
    </body>
    </html>

add to page by
    <div th:replace="fragmentfilepath :: my-partial">
        This div will be *replaced* by the fragment
    </div>
OR BY
    <div th:insert="fragmentfilepath :: my-partial">
        The entire content of the partial will be *included* inside this div.
    </div>


<div th:insert="fragmentfilepath :: my-partial">
file name :: which fragment

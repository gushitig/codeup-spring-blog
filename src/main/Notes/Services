Services
A service is a special type of class that provides a way to interact with some functionality in the application in a simpler way. A service can provide all sorts of different functionality, for example:
Send emails
Uploading files - cloud storage these days
Interacting with database tables (JPA repositories)
Interacting with an external API


Here is an example service class which could be used to notify the user when a new Ad has been created:
@Service("mailService")
public class EmailService {

    @Autowired
    public JavaMailSender emailSender;

    @Value("${spring.mail.from}")
    private String from;

    public void prepareAndSend(Ad ad, String subject, String body) {
        SimpleMailMessage msg = new SimpleMailMessage();
        msg.setFrom(from);
        msg.setTo(ad.getOwner().getEmail());
        msg.setSubject(subject);
        msg.setText(body);

        try{
            this.emailSender.send(msg);
        }
        catch (MailException ex) {
            // simply log it and go on...
            System.err.println(ex.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

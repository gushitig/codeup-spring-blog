Annotations

-Annotations are used to provide metadata for Java code. Annotations don't modify the execution of code; however, they can be consumed in order to perform additional logic.

-The @ character signals to the compiler that this is an annotation

-A Java annotation can also have elements for which you can set values.
 @Entity(table = "vehicles")`



 @Deprecated - used to indicate that a class, method, or field should no longer be used


 @Override - used above methods that are intended to override a method in a superclass. If the method does not match a method in the superclass, the compiler will give you an error.


 @SuppressWarnings annotation makes the compiler suppress warnings for a given method. For instance, if a method makes an unchecked type cast, the compiler may generate a warning.

 @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
 public List<String> languages() {
     return new ArrayList();
 }




 you can make your own annotations
